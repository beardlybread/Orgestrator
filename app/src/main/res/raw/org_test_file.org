1. A list can hold other lists.
  - This list item should be the child of 1.
  - So should this one.
    + But this should be even further down the hierarchy.

Some text content here should not be connected to the lists above.

I think we're done here. I still need to be sure that wrapping the
content into the next line doesn't break this text object, though, so
I am still typing. Also I wanted to be sure that the line between this
paragraph and the previous one are generating two objects.
