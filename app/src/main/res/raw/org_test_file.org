This is some text that should be parented to the root of the
file. Sentences that carry over shouldn't be treated as a new text
object.

* Project
** Requirements/Restrictions
*** Constraints
**** Limit the initial features to only deal with to-do lists.
**** Adding and modifying items outside of marking "DONE" must be done in Emacs.
**** Files must be kept on Google Drive.
**** Nothing but to-do items is visible from the app.
**** To-do list length will not change after creation.
*** Requirements
**** When an item is checked, it should be marked "DONE" in the underlying file.
**** When an item is unchecked, it should be marked "TODO" in the underlying file.
**** When an item is repeatable and checked/unchecked, the time should be updated.
**** App should list all to-do items across all files.
**** The path to each item will be available in the app list.
**** Any deadline or schedule time will be visible for the item.

- a deer, a female deer
- a drop of golden sun
- a name I call myself
- a long, long way to run
- a needle pulling thread
- a note to follow so
- a drink with jam and bread
- see: a deer...
  This line should be connected to "see: a deer..."

*** Level 3
| Name  | Value |
|-------+-------|
| one   |     1 |

| three |     3 |
| four  |     4 |
| five  |     5 |

1. A list can hold other lists.
  - This list item should be the child of 1.
  - So should this one.
    + But this should be even further down the hierarchy.

Some text content here should not be connected to the lists above.

I think we're done here. I still need to be sure that wrapping the
content into the next line doesn't break this text object, though, so
I am still typing. Also I wanted to be sure that the line between this
paragraph and the previous one are generating two objects.
