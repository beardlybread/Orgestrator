This is some text that should be parented to the root of the
file. Sentences that carry over shouldn't be treated as a new text
object.

* Project
** Requirements/Restrictions
- Limit the initial features to only deal with to-do options.
  + App should list all to-do items across potentially multiple files.
  + Path to the to-do (file and parents) should be available to view.
  + When an item is checked, it should be marked DONE in the underlying file.
  + When an item is checked and repeatable, the times should be adjusted accordingly.
  + If an item is unchecked, it will revert to TODO. No support for other options for now.
  + If an item is unchecked, repeatable items should roll back to previous LAST_REPEAT.
- Adding and modifying items outside of marking DONE must be done in Emacs.
- Files must be kept on Google Drive.
- Nothing but to-do items is visible from the app.

- a deer, a female deer
- a drop of golden sun
- a name I call myself
- a long, long way to run
- a needle pulling thread
- a note to follow so
- a drink with jam and bread
- see: a deer...
  This line should be connected to "see: a deer..."

*** Level 3
| Name  | Value |
|-------+-------|
| one   |     1 |

| three |     3 |
| four  |     4 |
| five  |     5 |

1. A list can hold other lists.
  - This list item should be the child of 1.
  - So should this one.
    + But this should be even further down the hierarchy.

Some text content here should not be connected to the lists above.

I think we're done here. I still need to be sure that wrapping the
content into the next line doesn't break this text object, though, so
I am still typing. Also I wanted to be sure that the line between this
paragraph and the previous one are generating two objects.
